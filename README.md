**Artist API**

This is a Django backend project that implements a database schema for clients, artists, and their works. It also includes a REST API with endpoints for viewing works and registering new users.

Getting Started
To run the project, you need to install Python 3 and Django 3.2. Clone the repository and run the following commands to migrate the database and start the development server:
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py runserver

You can access the project at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Database Schema
The project includes three models: Client, Artist, and Work. Here's a description of each model:

Client Model
The Client model represents a client in the database. It has two fields: name and user. The name field stores the name of the client, while the user field is a foreign key to the built-in Django User model.

Artist Model
The Artist model represents an artist in the database. It has two fields: name and work. The name field stores the name of the artist, while the work field is a ManyToManyField to the Work model.

Work Model
The Work model represents a work created by an artist. It has two fields: link and work_type. The link field stores the URL link for the work, while the work_type field stores the type of work created. The work type can be one of three values: Youtube, Instagram, or Other.

Signals
After each new user registration, a new Client object is automatically created using Django signals.

REST API
The project includes a REST API with the following endpoints:

Works Endpoint
This endpoint returns a list of works. You can filter the list by work type and search for works by artist name.

URL
/api/works

HTTP Method
GET

URL Parameters
work_type (optional): Filter works by type (e.g., Youtube, Instagram, or Other).
